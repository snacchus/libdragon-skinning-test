# libdragon-skinning-test

This is a small test ROM for the Nintendo 64 made with the unstable branch of [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon).
It demonstrates the skinned mesh rendering feature of libdragon's model64 format, and serves as a basis for performance profiling.

Some example profiling results can be found in the "profiling-results" directory.
The filenames contain the commit of libdragon that was used to compile the ROM, and the number of maximum matrices libdragon was configured with.
